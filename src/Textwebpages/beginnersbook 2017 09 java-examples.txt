Reply Mohit Tyagi says June 25, 2020 at 5:27 AM Four mistakes: 1. main method should have String []args as arguments instead of age. Use public static void main(String args[]) 2. age should be declared as a variable before using. Use int age=10; 3. System.out.println instead of system.out.println. 4.Closing bracket fro class p3 missing. Use } at last.
