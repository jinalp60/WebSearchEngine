This framework has several useful classes which have tons of useful functions which makes a programmer task super easy. I have written several tutorials on Collections in Java. All the tutorials are shared with examples and source codes to help you understand better. Java Collections ? Table of Contents 1. ArrayList 2. LinkedList 3. Vector 4. HashSet 5. LinkedHashSet 6. TreeSet 7. HashMap 8. TreeMap 9. LinkedHashMap 10. Hashtable 11. Iterator and ListIterator 12. Comparable and Comparator 13. Java Collections Interview Questions Collections Framework hierarchy Java Collections ? List A List is an ordered Collection (sometimes called a sequence). Lists may contain duplicate elements. Elements can be inserted or accessed by their position in the list, using a zero-based index. ArrayList Here is the list of all the tutorials published on the ArrayList. ArrayList Basics ArrayList in Java Initialize ArrayList Loop ArrayList Find length of ArrayList ArrayList Sorting Sort ArrayList Sort ArrayList in Descending order Sort ArrayList of Objects using Comparable and Comparator ArrayList Add/Remove Add element to ArrayList Add element at particular index of ArrayList Append Collection elements to ArrayList Copy All List elements to ArrayList Insert all the collection elements to the specified position in ArrayList Remove element from the specified index in ArrayList Remove specified element from ArrayList Get/Search in ArrayList Get Sub List of ArrayList Get the index of last occurrence of the element in the ArrayList Get element from ArrayList Get the index of first occurrence of the element in the ArrayList Check whether element exists in ArrayList Other Tutorials on ArrayList Compare two ArrayList Synchronize ArrayList Swap two elements in ArrayList Override toString() method ? ArrayList Serialize ArrayList Join two ArrayList Clone ArrayList to another ArrayList Make ArrayList Empty Check whether ArrayList is empty or not Trim the Size of ArrayList Replace the value of existing element in ArrayList Increase the capacity(size) of ArrayList ArrayList Conversions: Convert ArrayList to String Array Convert Array to ArrayList Differences: ArrayList vs Vector ArrayList vs HashMap ArrayList vs LinkedList LinkedList Here is the list of all the tutorials published on the LinkedList. LinkedList Basics LinkedList in Java How to iterate LinkedList LinkedList Add/Remove Adding an element to LinkedList Add element at specific index in LinkedList Add element at the beginning and end of LinkedList Adding an element to the front of LinkedList Remove First and last elements from LinkedList Remove element from specific index Remove specified element from LinkedList Remove All elements from LinkedList Append all the elements of a List to LinkedList Get/Search in LinkedList Get first and last elements from LinkedList Get element from specific index of LinkedList Search element in LinkedList Get Sub list of LinkedList LinkedList Iterator/ListIterator LinkedList Iterator example LinkedList ListIterator example Iterate a LinkedList in reverse Order Other Tutorials on LinkedList Replace element with a new value in LinkedList Check whether a particular element exists in LinkedList Clone a LinkedList to another LinkedList Get the index of last occurrence of an element in LinkedList LinkedList push() and pop() methods LinkedList poll(), pollFirst() and pollLast() methods LinkedList peek(), peekFirst() and peekLast() methods Conversion Convert LinkedList to ArrayList Convert LinkedList to Array Vector Here is the list of all the tutorials published on the Vector. Vector basics Vector in Java Get sub list from Vector Sort Vector using Collections.sort() Search element in Vector using index Copy Elements of one Vector to another Remove/Sort/Replace in Vector Remove element from Vector Remove element from specified index in Vector Remove all elements from Vector Replace element in Vector Set Vector size Vector -Iterator/ListIterator/Enumeration Vector enumeration example Vector Iterator example Vector ListIterator example Conversions Convert Vector to List Convert Vector to ArrayList Convert Vector to String Array Java Collections ? Set A Set is a Collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. There are three main implementations of Set interface: HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet. HashSet, which stores its elements in a hash table, is the best-performing implementation; however it makes no guarantees concerning the order of iteration. TreeSet, which stores its elements in a red-black tree, orders its elements based on their values; it is substantially slower than HashSet. LinkedHashSet, which is implemented as a hash table with a linked list running through it, orders its elements based on the order in which they were inserted into the set (insertion-order). HashSet Here is the list of all the tutorials published on the HashSet. HashSet in Java Delete all elements from HashSet How to iterate through a HashSet Convert a HashSet to an array Convert a HashSet to a TreeSet Convert HashSet to a List/ArrayList HashSet vs HashMap LinkedHashSet LinkedHashSet in Java List Vs Set TreeSet TreeSet in Java HashSet vs TreeSet Java Collections ? Map A Map is an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys. There are three main implementations of Map interfaces: HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap. HashMap: it makes no guarantees concerning the order of iteration TreeMap: It stores its elements in a red-black tree, orders its elements based on their values; it is substantially slower than HashMap. LinkedHashMap: It orders its elements based on the order in which they were inserted into the set (insertion-order). HashMap Here is the list of all the tutorials published on the HashMap. HashMap Basics HashMap in Java How to iterate HashMap Sort HashMap by Keys and values Get Size of HashMap Remove Key-value mapping from HashMap Remove all mapping from HashMap How to check if HashMap is empty or not? Get/Search in HashMap Check if particular key exists in HashMap Check if particular value exists in HashMap Serialize/Synchronize Serialize HashMap Synchronize HashMap Differences HashMap vs Hashtable HashSet vs HashMap Other Tutorials on HashMap HashMap Iterator example Copy one HashMap to another Get value from HashMap using Key Get Set view of keys from HashMap Clone a HashMap TreeMap TreeMap in Java Iterate TreeMap Sort TreeMap Iterate TreeMap in Reverse order Get Sub Map from TreeMap LinkedHashMap LinkedHashMap in Java Hashtable Hashtable in Java Java Collections ? Iterator/ListIterator Both Iterator and ListIterator are used to iterate through elements of a collection class. Using Iterator we can traverse in one direction (forward) while using ListIterator we can traverse the collection class on both the directions(backward and forward). To know more differences between these two refer this article: Difference between Iterator and ListIterator. Iterator ListIterator Comparable and Comparator Interfaces These interfaces are used for sorting objects of user defined class (custom class). Comparable interface with example Comparator interface with example Collections Interview Questions Collections Framework Interview Questions Reference: Official Document on Collections Comments veeru says August 12, 2014 at 1:54 PM Hi Sir, I thank you very much for posting such an awesome java content. The way you explained the Concepts are very clear. But I am not able to find topics on List and Set. Could you please let me know the link for accessing the List and set related topics ? Rgds, Manvi Reply Chaitanya Singh says September 16, 2014 at 6:02 PM Thank you for your kind words. I have updated the page by providing links of List and Set related tutorials, you can find the same above. Reply sravani says September 26, 2014 at 8:06 AM Hi sir, This site is simply awesome.Thanks for your efforts. we need more concepts from you like struts,hibernate ?.! Reply Sundar says October 21, 2014 at 5:15 AM Hai Sir, This site is very useful for learners.I had one doubt, the doubt is, in hashmap and array concept we will display line and bar graph in one page with data input and cluster in JSP.what is the source code .Kindly tell me.Please send source code in my mail. Thank you. Reply Ror says October 23, 2014 at 11:29 AM This site helps me a lot. Reply avinash singh says July 16, 2015 at 9:52 AM it is very easy program .i have understood and you will understand Reply sriram says November 1, 2014 at 1:28 AM Hi Chaitanya, Your content,depth of knowledge in the concepts is simply superb,mind blowing and awesome,i have visited many blogs and sites to learn the concepts in a easily understandable way, but i didn?t find any, but when i came across your site accidentally, i was amazed by way you make readers understand the concepts. All these years i was feared of looking at the concepts of collections even,but now, after going through your site. That fear in me no more exist!!!! I thanks you from my bottom of heart for your kind knowledge sharing. Regards, Sriram. Reply Kalkidan Ferede says November 27, 2014 at 11:20 PM I was looking for this kind of organized concept based tutorial on the Internet for an hour. indeed I succeeded! thank you sir! do you also have tutorials on JSF, hibernate, EJP, JPA, Spring, struts ? I really need to learn this topics from you if it is available. keep the good work! Reply Kalkidan Ferede says November 27, 2014 at 11:29 PM Awsome! can you add why we need Iterator? why can?t we use loops(for loop, while loop, do while)? Reply Jitendra Gupta says April 25, 2016 at 1:00 PM Hi kalkidan, Iterator is used to iterate the element in one direction. It?s having three method. 1. boolean hasNext( ) 2. Object next( ) 3. void remove( ) The best example you can use Iterator is List list = new ArrayList(); list.add(object1) list.add(object2); Iterator it = list.iterator(); while(it.hasNext() ){ Object obj = (Object)it.next(); } Reply Navin Israni says June 9, 2016 at 5:46 AM Not all Collections provide index-based access, so we cannot always use while and do-while. There is an enhanced version of ?for? that can be used without index access. In cases, where there is no index based access (i.e. set), we use an Iterator, otherwise it use your choice to choose the iteration method if the index is available to you.

Reply Lib29 says January 20, 2016 at 7:24 PM Thank You for giving a clear & precise understanding of Collections Framework. You have literally removed my fear of Collections. Keep up the Good Work. Thanks once again from the bottom of my heart!!!:) Reply Brent Grigsby says January 29, 2016 at 6:31 PM Probably your best source for information on the Stack class is Oracle.com for the version of Java you are using. It will act similar to the other collection classes described here. P.S. Nice job of explaining collection classes. I really like ArrayList because it dynamically grows as elements are added, eliminating array out of bounds exceptions. Thanks, Brent Reply sukirti shukla says January 31, 2016 at 6:53 AM Sir i really like ur site and its content, everything is very organized and detailed, every topic is being covered with fine details. for a beginner this site is very useful,i request u sir to please introduce such type matter for data structure also.please Reply kavitha says February 1, 2016 at 8:33 AM hi sir your site is simply superb and easy to learn java! especially collections are very easy to understand and examples are really awesome! compared to other sites this one is very nice and easy to learn! :) Reply Alekh Nema says February 13, 2016 at 4:27 PM if collection is an interface and list also being an interface then..what i understand is list implements collection ?but i also know that interface cannot implement another interface?than what is the justification for this? Reply aditya patel says April 20, 2016 at 11:13 AM List is interface . Collection is interface . one interface always extends another interface . so List extends Collection Reply Mary says February 19, 2016 at 4:18 AM Thank you SO much! Literally saved me from failing my midterm. Reply Suni says February 25, 2016 at 11:26 AM Awesome material!!! Reply Riya says March 1, 2016 at 4:51 PM is map an object or interface? Reply vignesh says August 10, 2016 at 10:35 AM map is a interface? Reply Swetha says March 3, 2016 at 6:23 AM Hi , Hash Map can contain duplicate key values. Please correct it. Great Job !! The Beginner?s book is one of the best sources to learn and make concepts clear.Thank you very much for your efforts. Swetha. Reply Navin Prakash Israni says June 9, 2016 at 5:51 AM HashMap can contain only one null key (and that key cannot have any value, because you can?t access the null key!). So having a null key as good as useless.
